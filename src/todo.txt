test
Engine: 
- Add support for other types of rendering with buffers and HW TnL.

- Add more pixel formats to UnclippedBlt, for surfaces outside of Begin/EndScene pairs.

- Finish ImageTransfer 16/24bit->32bit (to restore mdlc on the original artwork)

- Fix mdlc
	- convert works again for engine supported formats only.
	- need 24bpp -> 32bpp support and CreateCompatibleSurface enhancments 


Alliances:
- Change imbal behavior (1/2/NA/Auto)
		One method would be to force autobalance when alliances are on then have
	player/rank count totals based on ally group instead of side.
		Imbal is seriosuly bugged!  Consider reverting back to msoriginal and starting over.

- Game types other than conquest?

- "Nerf" options, if necessary:
	- Visibility toggle
	- Scan toggle


Other/Cleanup:
- Use MSBuild features (VS2010) to stop running the cscript custom tasks unnecessarily.

- Clean linker warnings in ZLib, Utility & IGC.

- Move stuff in 'Test' directory to a more logical location then delete 'Test' (Just TCLib)

- Remove unneeded libs in "linker/input/add. dep." setting of all projects
