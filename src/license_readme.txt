Hello,

As of 7/27/2017, Microsoft Research has graciously let me change the license.txt file that Allegiance was
distributed under to an MIT based license which can be found in the included license.txt file. The original 
MSR-SSLA license no longer applies to this software distribution. For proof of this license change, please
see the included AllegianceReleaseLetter.pdf. This file contains the specific permissions from Microsoft 
to make this license change. Please contact Nick Pirocanac (nick@zaphop.com) with any additional questions.


Thank you, and hope to see you in the game.

Nick Pirocanac (nick@zaphop.com)
